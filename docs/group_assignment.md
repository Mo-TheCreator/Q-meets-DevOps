## Group discussion
When you are ready with the pull request exercise please check if there are any group members who needs some help. Help them when needed.

If everyone has completed the pull request please discuss the following questions as a group:
- [ ] What opportunities do you see for using pull request in supporting Quality Engineering?
- [ ] How can you integrate pull requests in your current way of working?
- [ ] Are there any challenges or risks you see in implementing pull requests?
 
We will share the outcome of this group discussion afterwards in the plenairy session.
