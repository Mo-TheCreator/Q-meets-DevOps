Welcome on the Q meets DevOps: Pull on Quality page. This page is created to guide you trough the process of creating a code change and setting up pull request that can be reviewed by someone else. After the review and when the change is ok it can be merged with de current version of the software.
The steps we will take are:
1. [Set up your branch](set_up_branch.md)
2. [Adding a new feature](adding_a_feature.md)
3. [Merging the feature using a pull request](merging_a_feature.md)

After the pull request exercise we have some questions for you as a group.

[Group assignment](group_assignment.md)
